# hello-world
<br>I worked for a long time as a teacher, but got burnt out by that and now I've switched fields to becomming a computer nerd (as I've always known that I have a knack for, but never really explored before).
<br>I live in Stockholm, Sweden, I'm 40 years old, I'm a song and dance man with too much imagination and curiosity in comparison to time, energy and ability to concentrate on one thing at a time.
<br>Giddy up (or as I presume you say here; gitty up)!
